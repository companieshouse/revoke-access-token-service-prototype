      <p class="govuk-body">Third-party apps are software applications created by external developers for use with Companies House services. They are not created or owned by Companies House.
      </p>
      <p>You can choose to connect a third-party app to your Companies House account. This will give it permission to access company information.</p>
      <p>There are different types of permission you can give, including:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>read, which allows the app to view and collect company information</li>
        <li>write, which allows the app to make changes to your account, including submitting information on your behalf
        </li>

      </ul>
      <p>Consider the security of an app before granting it permission to access your company information.
